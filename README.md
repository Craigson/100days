# 100days

"100 Days of Making" is a class at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program that focuses on creating a routine structured around a daily art practice.  I chose to focus on Creative coding, beginning with an exploration of basic OpenGL and moving towards more advanced topics.

I'm focusing on the Cinder development environment and C++, before moving on to WebGL and Three.js.

My process is documented on [my website](http://craigpickard.net/work#/100-days/) and the animated versions of each sketch can be found on my [Tumblr](http://madebycraig.tumblr.com/).
